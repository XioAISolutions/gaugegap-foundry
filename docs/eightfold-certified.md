# Certified Eightfold-Way / Gell-Mann–Okubo Benchmark

A finite, machine-checked realization of the **Eightfold Way** — the SU(3)-flavor
classification of hadrons — and its **Gell-Mann–Okubo (GMO)** mass relations,
built on the same rigorous interval-arithmetic machinery as the rest of this
repository.

## The idea

The Eightfold Way organizes baryons into an SU(3)-flavor **octet** and
**decuplet**. Its mathematical content is a mass operator on a multiplet that is
a flavor singlet plus a term transforming like the hypercharge (`T_8`) component
of an octet:

```
M = a·1 + b·Y + c·(I(I+1) − Y²/4)
```

where `Y` is hypercharge and `I` isospin. We build this operator as a certified
real-symmetric **interval matrix** and run it through
`verified_hermitian_eigenvalues`, so the multiplet structure and the mass
relations come out as certified finite-system bounds.

## What is certified

Run it:

```bash
python3 scripts/run_eightfold.py
pytest tests/test_eightfold.py -q
```

**(A) Multiplet structure.** The certified eigenvalue enclosures show the
symmetry breaking lifting the degeneracy:

| operator | certified distinct levels | cluster sizes |
|----------|---------------------------|---------------|
| SU(3) limit (`b=c=0`) | 1 | `[8]` (full octet degeneracy) |
| octet breaking | 4 | `[2, 1, 3, 2]` = N, Λ, Σ, Ξ |

"Certified distinct" means the enclosures are pairwise disjoint, so the
eigenvalues are provably different — a machine-checked statement that the
breaking term splits the octet into exactly the four isospin multiplets
N(2) + Λ(1) + Σ(3) + Ξ(2) = 8.

**(B) The GMO relation is certified exact for the model.** Evaluated in interval
arithmetic on the operator's own levels,

```
2(M_N + M_Ξ) − 3·M_Λ − M_Σ  =  [0, 0]   (certified)
```

for every choice of `a, b, c` — because the breaking term transforms as an
octet.

**(C) Certified relations battery (PDG masses with uncertainties).** Every
standard SU(3)-flavor mass relation, evaluated in interval arithmetic so each
residual is a certified enclosure propagated from the input mass uncertainties:

| relation | certified residual | rel. | encloses 0? |
|----------|--------------------|------|-------------|
| baryon octet GMO `2(N+Ξ)−3Λ−Σ` | `[−25.96, −25.62]` MeV | 0.57% | no |
| decuplet spacing `(Ξ*−Σ*)−(Σ*−Δ)` | `[−7.00, −0.20]` MeV | 2.4% | no |
| decuplet spacing `(Ω−Ξ*)−(Ξ*−Σ*)` | `[−9.54, −5.36]` MeV | 4.9% | no |
| pseudoscalar GMO `4K²−3η²−π²` (quadratic) | `≈ [5.48, 5.50]×10⁴` MeV² | 5.6% | no |
| Coleman–Glashow `(n−p)+(Ξ⁻−Ξ⁰)−(Σ⁻−Σ⁺)` | `[−0.31, 0.43]` MeV | 0.8% | **yes** |

The residuals quantify, with certified bounds, exactly how well each symmetry
relation holds: the octet GMO breaking is `≈ −26` MeV (0.57%), the pseudoscalar
GMO carries the well-known `≈ 5.6%` shift from η–η′ mixing, and the
electromagnetic **Coleman–Glashow** relation is certified *consistent with zero*.

**(D) Derived certified quantities.**

- **Constituent quark masses** (decuplet additive model, `Δ=qqq`, `Ω=sss`):
  `m_q ≈ [410.3, 411.0]`, `m_s ≈ [557.4, 557.6]` MeV, with strange–light
  splitting `m_s − m_q ≈ [146.4, 147.2]` MeV — the scale that sets the decuplet
  equal spacing.
- **The Ω⁻ prediction.** Equal spacing gives `M_Ω = 2·M_Ξ* − M_Σ*`; the certified
  prediction `≈ [1678.1, 1681.7]` MeV vs. measured `1672.45 ± 0.29` (~0.45%) —
  the historic confirmation of the Eightfold Way, as a certified interval.
- **η–η′ mixing.** From a 2×2 mass-squared system (octet `m₈²` fixed by GMO), the
  off-diagonal `t²` is certified strictly positive — a certified consistency
  check that a real octet–singlet mixing angle exists.

**(E) Vector-meson nonet & ω–φ mixing.** Vector mesons mix almost ideally, so the
additive constituent picture predicts (linearly) `φ = 2K* − ρ` (s‑s̄) and
`ω = ρ` (light quark). Certified residuals: φ ≈ `[−12.1, −10.6]` MeV (1.1%),
ω ≈ `[−7.8, −7.0]` MeV (0.95%). The octet–singlet mixing strength `t²` (from the
2×2 mass-squared system) is certified strictly positive.

**(F) Baryon magnetic moments (SU(6) quark model).** Constituent quark moments
are extracted from `(p, n, Λ)`: `μ_u ≈ 1.852`, `μ_d ≈ −0.972`, `μ_s ≈ −0.613` μ_N.
The remaining moments are then parameter-free, reported as certified residuals
(predicted − measured), at the known quark-model accuracy:

| quantity | certified residual | rel. |
|----------|--------------------|------|
| μ(Σ⁺) | `[0.204, 0.227]` | 8.8% |
| μ(Σ⁻) | `[0.042, 0.095]` | 5.9% |
| μ(Ξ⁰) | `[−0.204, −0.165]` | 14.8% |
| μ(Ξ⁻) | `[0.150, 0.165]` | 24.2% |
| μ_p/μ_n vs −3/2 | `[0.040, 0.040]` | — |
| **μ(Σ⁰→Λ) transition − meas** | `[−0.060, 0.100]` | **encloses 0** |

The parameter-free ratio `μ_p/μ_n = −3/2` is reproduced (measured −1.46), and the
SU(6) **Σ⁰→Λ transition moment** `(μ_u−μ_d)/√3` is certified *consistent with the
measured* `1.61 ± 0.08` μ_N. The model also predicts `μ(Σ⁰) = ½(μ(Σ⁺)+μ(Σ⁻))`.

**(G) Isospin decay ratios.** Squared Clebsch–Gordan branching ratios are exact
rationals — certified zero-width: `Δ⁺→pπ⁰ : nπ⁺ = 2:1`, `Δ⁰→nπ⁰ : pπ⁻ = 2:1`,
`K*⁺→K⁰π⁺ : K⁺π⁰ = 2:1`. Parameter-free predictions of isospin symmetry.

**(H) Gell-Mann–Nishijima.** `Q = I₃ + Y/2` is certified exact `[0, 0]` across all
17 octet + decuplet states — the structural backbone of the classification.

**(I) SU(3) representation theory.** The tensor decompositions are certified-exact
identities (`product dim − Σ summand dims = [0, 0]`): `3⊗3̄ = 1⊕8` (mesons),
`3⊗3 = 3̄⊕6`, `3⊗3⊗3 = 1⊕8⊕8⊕10` (baryons), `8⊗8 = 1⊕8⊕8⊕10⊕10̄⊕27`, using the
SU(3) dimension formula `dim(p,q) = (p+1)(q+1)(p+q+2)/2`.

**(J) Weak (Cabibbo) sector.** From PDG CKM inputs:
- **First-row unitarity** `|V_ud|²+|V_us|²+|V_ub|²−1 = [−0.0025, −0.0006]` — a
  certified interval that *does not* enclose zero, i.e. the known ~few-σ
  first-row (Cabibbo-angle) unitarity deficit. This is arithmetic on PDG inputs,
  not a discovery claim.
- **Cabibbo angle** `θ_C = atan(|V_us|/|V_ud|) = [12.92, 13.02]°` (certified via
  the monotonic `atan` on the ratio enclosure).
- **Axial coupling** `(F+D) − g_A = [−0.026, 0.009]` — certified consistent with
  zero (the SU(3) hyperon-fit `F, D` reproduce the nucleon `g_A`).

**(K) Weight diagrams.** The runner emits the `(I₃, Y)` weight diagrams (the octet
hexagon and the decuplet triangle) as SVG to `figures/`.

## Relation to the rest of the repo

This reuses `gaugegap.rigorous.interval_arithmetic` (the directed-rounding
`Interval` type and `verified_hermitian_eigenvalues`) — the same certified
eigenvalue machinery used by the CurveRank spectral-screening track. It is a
separate physics application of that infrastructure and shares no claims with
the Riemann/Hilbert–Pólya work.
